# Flow API
Hi there. Welcome to the Flow API. Remember, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE LOWERCASE.
## API V1
Every URL starts with 'imaginegamestech.github.io/flow-api/<parameters>'.
### Profiles
#### Profile
If you have the ID of the account, use /profile/<profile id>.
#### Profile Without ID
If you do not know the ID of the account, use /profileidget/<username>, which will give you the ID of the username provided. Then use /profile/<profile id>.

## API V2
COMING SOON WITH THE RELEASE OF THE SEASON 2!
